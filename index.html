            <p>My name is Chelsea.  I was born and raised in Reno, NV, USA.  I am currently a stay at home mother to four wonderful children that are the light of my life and wife to my best friend and high school sweetheart.  I love to do anything I can to spend time with my family and travel and experience new things with them.</p>
